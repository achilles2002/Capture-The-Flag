### **Challange** 

      Your mission is to enter Dr. Evil's laboratory and retrieve the blueprints for his Doomsday Project.
      The laboratory is protected by a series of locked vault doors. Each door is controlled by a computer 
      and requires a password to open. Unfortunately, our undercover agents have not been able to obtain the
      secret passwords for the vault doors, but one of our junior agents obtained the source code for each 
      vault's computer! You will need to read the source code for each level to figure out what the password 
      is for that vault door. As a warmup, we have created a replica vault in our training facility. The source 
      code for the training vault is here: VaultDoorTraining.java

To solve this challenge, we need to understand how the **VaultDoorTraining.java** code works to retrieve the correct password. Here are the steps to solve this CTF:

### **Code Analysis**

1. **The `picoCTF{}` Format Requirement**  
   - The program requires the user to input a password in the format `picoCTF{...}`.
   - The code `userInput.substring("picoCTF{".length(), userInput.length()-1)` removes the `"picoCTF{"` prefix and the closing `}` from the user input.

   Example:  
   If the user inputs:  
   ```plaintext
   picoCTF{password}
   ```
   The program will extract and check only the string `password`.

2. **The `checkPassword` Function**  
   - This function checks if the extracted `password` matches the hardcoded string:  
     ```plaintext
     w4rm1ng_Up_w1tH_jAv4_eec0716b713
     ```

3. **Conclusion**  
   - The correct password for the vault is:  
     ```plaintext
     picoCTF{w4rm1ng_Up_w1tH_jAv4_eec0716b713}
     ```

### **Final Answer**
The password to solve this challenge is:  
```plaintext
picoCTF{w4rm1ng_Up_w1tH_jAv4_eec0716b713}
```
